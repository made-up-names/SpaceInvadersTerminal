# Space Invaders

### GAME DESCRIPTION:

This game 'Space Invaders' is a primitive recreation of the classic arcade game of the same name, coded in python(without pygame). 
The spaceship , denoted by 'A' , present in the 1st row, can move to its left or right.
The alien, denoted by '$', is spawned every 10 seconds in a random position in the 7th and 8th rows. Each alien self destructs after 8 seconds.
There are 2 kinds of missiles : 'i' and 'I'.
	- 'i' moves 1 row up per second .On colliding with the alien, the alien disappears instantly and adds 1 point to the score of the user.
	- 'I' moves twice as fast as 'i' , but on colliding with the alien, the alien doesn't disappear instantly , instead it disfigures into 'Q' form, and stays for 5 seconds, after which it gets destroyed and adds to the score.

To play the game, type the command 'python main.py' in the terminal.
To quit , PRESS 'q'
